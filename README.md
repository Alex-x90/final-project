A simple forum site. When not logged in a user can view posts and replies but cannot respond. Once logged in a user can makes posts,
reply to other people's posts, and edit or delete their own posts/replies. Each post has the user that posted it, the time and the 
date, and orignal posts also include the title.Links and email addresses that are put in post text are converted to live links.
